        The following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use") govern your access and/or use of the Wawa application/platform ("Wawa").
    </p>
    <p>
        These Terms of Use may be updated or revised at any time and your continued access and/or use of the Wawa application after any such update or revision shall constitute your agreement to be bound by such update or revision.

        <h3>1. Searching and Booking on Wawa</h3>
        <div class="subsection">
            <p><strong>1.1 Searching</strong><br>
            You can explore available Host Services on Wawa by using filters such as type of service, accommodation, destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You may further refine your search results using various criteria. These results are prioritized based on relevance, which is determined by factors such as price, availability, reviews, past customer service performance, cancellation history, popularity, and saved listings, among others.</p>

            <p><strong>1.2 Booking</strong><br>
            When booking an activity listing on Wawa, you agree to pay the stated total price, which includes the listing price, Wawa service fees, offline charges, applicable taxes, and any other costs displayed during checkout. If you opt to pay in a currency different from the one set by the Host, the price will be converted based on Wawa's determined conversion rate. A contract between you and the Host is formed once you receive the booking confirmation. Along with these Terms, you must adhere to the reservation terms, including cancellation policies, rules, and requirements provided by the Host during the checkout process. For the avoidance of doubt, while Wawa provides the booking platform, we are not party to the transactions entered into between you and the Hosts.</p>

            <p><strong>1.4 Your Responsibilities</strong><br>
            When you book an activity or other services, you confirm that you and anyone accompanying you meet any age, fitness, or other requirements. You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions that may affect participation. Only guests included in the reservation can join the experience unless explicitly allowed.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, Refunds, and Modifications</h3>

            <p><strong>2.2 Booking Modifications</strong><br>

            When a booking request is accepted or confirmed via Wawa, a direct contract between the Host and the Guest is established. For the avoidance of doubt, while Wawa provides the booking platform, we are not party to the transactions entered into between the Host and the Guest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Host agrees to provide the Host Services as described in the listing and abide by Wawa's policies and terms.</p>

            <p>In providing the Host Services under an Experience Package, Wawa has made arrangements with third parties (such as accommodation providers) to offer certain benefits to the Host, subject that such benefits are to be provided under a direct contract between the Host and the third party. It is the responsibility of the Host to ensure that such benefits indicated under the Experience Package are enforced under its contract with such third party.</p>

            <p><strong>1.3 Host Independence</strong><br>
            Hosts are independent service providers and not employees of Wawa.</p>

            <p><strong>1.4 Legal Compliance</strong><br>

            <p><strong>1.7 Indemnity</strong><br>
            The Host shall indemnify Wawa for any claims, loss, damages and expenses incurred or suffered due to the acts and omissions and/or breach of contract by itself and/or its team members.</p>

            <p><strong>1.8 Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Booking Modifications</strong></p>
            <p>(a) <strong>Cancellations and Reservation Issues</strong><br>
